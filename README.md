# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

The goal of this project is to be able to classify songs as Rock or Hip-Hop without actually hearing them. I aim to do this with the help of the audio data available.

In doing so, I do the following:
1. Clean the data
2. Perform exploratory data visualization of the data
3. Feature reduction (Correlation and Principal Component Analysis)
4. Use ML algorithms like decision trees and logistic regression to train the model

Audio data of almost 5000 different songs are used. Data needed is contained in two files, one CSV file which contains basic information about the track along with the genre and a JSON file containing muscial features like danceability and acousticness. This data was complied by The Echo Nest (a research group).
